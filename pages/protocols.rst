Protocols & ICDs 
================

This Section shows the various protocols used in the project. This could include sequence diagrams and ICDs for custom protocols. 

Some `MrT` utilities are able to generate documentation in `rst`. We can link directly to these documents in our project to add them to our design package. Below is a link to a gatt server ICD generated by mrt-ble
